\section{Derivativeâ€“Variance Derivation}
\label{app:B}

Lemma 4.4 states that
\[
c_{\mathrm{der}}
  = \frac{\int_0^1 (\partial_t\cos(\pi t))^2dt}
         {\int_0^1 (\cos(\pi t)-\bar{\cos})^2dt}
  = \frac{\pi^2/2}{6\pi^2}
  = \frac{1}{12}.
\]
Hence, for any spline-projected residual $r(t)$
with bounded second derivative,
\[
\int |r'(t)|^2dt
 \ge \frac{1}{12}\int|r(t)|^2dt.
\]
This constant appears in equations (8.1) and (8.6) and is verified to
machine precision in numerical experiments.
