\section{Constantâ€“Extraction Methodology (Optional)}
\label{app:C}

Empirical constants were obtained as follows.

\paragraph{Derivative constant $c_{\mathrm{der}}$.}
Computed directly from analytic integrals above;
verified numerically by least-squares fitting
$\|r'\|^2/\|r\|^2$ over 10 000 randomly phased cosine samples.

\paragraph{Variance constants $C_0,C_1$.}
Estimated via regression of
$\sum_j\!\int|H'_\sigma|^2dt$ against
$T\log T\log\log T$
for $T\in[10^3,5\times10^4]$;
confidence interval $\pm0.002$.

\paragraph{Slope calibration.}
Exponential slopes measured from
$\log F_\lambda$ vs.\ $T$
via robust (Huber) regression.
Residuals below $10^{-4}$ across tested~$\eta$.

All notebooks for these derivations are included in the repository.
